Description: This project is a Python-based command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to help beginner programmers understand how to build interactive applications while reinforcing key programming concepts. The calculator also includes a logging feature, which stores all user calculations and results in a text file (calc_log.txt) for future reference. This adds a real-world component of data persistence and file handling to a basic calculator project.

Features:

Perform basic operations: +, -, *, /
Handle invalid inputs gracefully
Log every calculation to a local text file
Modular and beginner-friendly code structure
# calculator
simple calculator with logging
